# Example that finds ORFs within a DNA sequence

In this code I am finding open reading frames (ORFs) within a DNA sequence. 

An ORF is a portion of a DNA sequence that has the potential to be translated into a protein. 

It starts with a start codon (usually "ATG" in most organisms) and ends with a stop codon (e.g., "TAA", "TAG", or "TGA").

The ORF class represents an open reading frame with its start position, end position, and sequence. 

The findORFs function searches for potential ORFs within the DNA sequence. 

It looks for start codons ("ATG") and then scans for the next stop codon to determine the end of the ORF. 

Once an ORF is found, it's added to the orfs array.
